# syntouch-intro-node-js

This is the repository containing code samples, exercises and supporting files for the SynTouch Introduction to Node.js event.
The workshop consists, apart from an introductory presentation, of two different tracks which both are preferrably to be executed on the provided Virtual Box Virtual Machine image.
Should you *really* want to do this outside the virtual machine, the VM environment contained:
- Ubuntu 17.10
- Node.js 8.9.4 & npm
- JSHint, nodemon
- Visual Studio Code including extensions
- Postman as native app
- Chromium Browser
- MongoDB 3.4.7

## Location of VM: TBD
## Tracks
The workshop consists of two tracks, the 'explorer' and the 'adventurer' track; both of these tracks are targetted at a different audience.

### Adventurer Track
The adventurer track is more challenging with regards to the amount of code to write; the track is intended for people who like to code and discover new languages.
This is a code-centric track, some hints will be provided as to how to achieve the task at hand. For this track, Google is your friend. If you're stuck: Ask!
